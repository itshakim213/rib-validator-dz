## Detailed Coverage Analysis

### AlgerianRibValidator
- **Line Coverage**: 100%
- **Branch Coverage**: 100%
- **Assessment**: Complete coverage of the main validation logic, including all paths for valid and invalid RIB scenarios, null/empty inputs, and format validation. The addition of the `ValidateRibs` method has increased the line and branch count while maintaining 100% coverage for this class.

### BankInfo and RibDetails
- **Line Coverage**: 100%
- **Branch Coverage**: N/A (no conditional logic)
- **Assessment**: Complete coverage of the record classes with no missing paths.

### Utilities
- **Line Coverage**: 100%
- **Branch Coverage**: 50%
- **Assessment**: The branch coverage indicates there's a conditional path in the `ComputeControlKeyFromAgencyAccount` method that isn't fully tested. Specifically, the condition when the key equals 0 (which should become 97) is not being tested.

### Generated Regex Code
- **Line Coverage**: ~87-90%
- **Branch Coverage**: ~66-81%
- **Assessment**: Good coverage of the generated regex validation code.

## Coverage Assessment

### Strengths
- Excellent overall line coverage at 91.1%, indicating that most of the codebase is tested. This is an improvement from the previous 90.8%.
- Complete coverage of the main validation logic in `AlgerianRibValidator`.
- Good testing of edge cases including null/empty inputs, invalid formats, and whitespace handling.
- Comprehensive testing of different bank codes and their information.
- Proper validation of both valid and invalid RIB scenarios.
- The new `ValidateRibs` method is well tested with comprehensive test coverage.
- Branch coverage has slightly improved to 76.5% from the previous 76%.

### Areas for Improvement
- Branch coverage of 76.5% indicates that some conditional paths are not fully explored.
- The 50% branch coverage in the `Utilities` class suggests that the specific condition for when the key calculation results in 0 is not being tested.
- There may be one conditional path in the control key calculation logic that could be better tested.

### Missing Test Cases
- A specific test case for the condition in `Utilities.ComputeControlKeyFromAgencyAccount` when the algorithm results in key 0 (which should become 97).

## Recommendation
The test suite continues to be comprehensive and provides high coverage of the core functionality. The addition of the `ValidateRibs` method has improved the overall line coverage to 91.1%. However, to achieve 100% branch coverage, consider adding one more test case to specifically test the scenario in `Utilities.ComputeControlKeyFromAgencyAccount` where the calculated key would be 0 (which gets converted to 97). This would ensure all conditional paths are properly tested. The new multiple RIB validation functionality is well covered by the test suite.
